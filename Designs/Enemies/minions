Minions generally have 0 or 1 gimmicks, and are relatively easy to kill.
They should be threatening in the early game (approximately as strong as one player), but fall off in the midgame
Each should have a 'basic' and 'upgraded' version that they slowly shift to in the midgame

Shadow beast
no gimmick.  Just has health and melee attacks.
Maybe give a single-use ranged attack for the upgraded version

Wolf
When it attacks someone, it locks on to them and prepares an attack for next turn.
If it doesn't get interrupted, it will dash up to (4?) spaces to get to that target, and deal medium damage to them.

Bat
Deals low damage at melee range.
Heals a bit of damage from ALL nearby shadow creatures

Turtle
Starts with a bit of armour.
When it attacks someone, they lose 1 armour and it gains 1 armour.

Light eater
considers light sources its enemy also.  If a light source is closer to it than the players are,
it will move towards that source, and reduce its radius each turn.  (Won't go for caravan)
