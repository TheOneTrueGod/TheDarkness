<Still workshopping this idea>
Have a few bosses that are randomly selected at the start of the campaign.
They'll show up in random missions early on, but their stats should make them mostly unbeatable.
The point is for the players to run away from them, and possibly lose someone to them.

In the late midgame, they should be beatable.  Once all of them are defeated, the endgame starts.

When they're going to show up in a mission, they should show up after a certain number of turns, and
some kind of warning should be given in the form of terrain effects.  Example;  When a fire one
is going to show up, random fires should start a few turns before he shows up, and then a meteor
should be forecasted falling where he'll spawn.

Skeleton man
Has a core body that moves around and attacks.  At the end of its turn, it summons one arm (up to a max of 6?)
The arms act as minions, moving around independantly.
If it winds up with 4 arms at the start of its turn, they'll all choose a target, and then grab that target 
and try to drag them off into the darkness
