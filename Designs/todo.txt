Abilities
[] Player units should start boarded inside the caravan.  They should be able to unboard it.
[X] Create the concept of unit abilities
[X] Show player unit abilities at the bottom when they're selected
[X] Able to select abilities at the bottom
[X] Able to use abilities by clicking on the screen
[] Animations
[] Previews of areas when hovering over an ability
[] Previews of effects when hovering over the map

Items
[] Players should have an inventory
[] Players inventory should have two flares in it.
[] Players should be able to use items in their inventory (start with flares)
[] Enemies can drop things -- players should be able to pick them up.

Flares
[] Create a 'token' on the field
[] Tokens can potentially give off light (probably need a list of "things that can produce light")
[] The flare should die down over time

Darkness
[] Players should take damage (or gain some negative effect) when they're in the Darkness

AI
[] Units need to spawn a little bit away from the light over time.
[] Explore mechanisms for this (Timer based?  "Rage" based, that reacts to player actions / units that already exist?)

Terrain
[] Need some variety in tiles
[] Need different tiles, and to blend between them
[] Need interactables (Food, materials, etc)

Multiplayer / networking stuff
[] Save the player's commands to the server when they hit end turn
[] Save the board state after the turn has finished playing out, and it's another player's turn
[] Record what turn a player last saw
[] When the board state loads, show the game play out from that turn until the end (then record that they've seen it all)
