Story Ideas

"""
1000 years ago The Darkness invaded the world you came from, like it did countless others.
When all seemed lost the <DEFENDERS_NAME> opened a portal for the last survivors, like it did with countless others.
But that's ancient history now.

You were born in the <DEFENDERS_NAME> collective, and have been recruited as part of the caravan squads.
Caravan missions into the darkness have become relatively safe and routine, as the Light Crystals are able to keep The Darkness at bay.
This one is different.
"""

- In the first mission, you are a well equipped soldier on a caravan mission to save some people from a recently attacked world
- One of the darkness titans shows up and destroys the caravan.
- You and your group have Light Crystals in your armour, so you're able to escape.
- The titan does not chase you, and you are able to find your way to an old, destroyed outpost
- The outpost has a working light generator, where you put your armour crystals into in order to start it up

Now you have your base, some recruits, and you have to rebuild enough

Story beats;
- At the beginning
- You have very little and need to scavenge what you can
- You need to build an anti-titan defense, and become self sufficient with food and light power
- If a unit dies, you don't get it back.

- In the early middle
- You learn about the different ways of improving.
  - Tech (Armour, weapons, gadgets)
  - Magic (the secondary powers this game is kind of built around)
  - Darkness (Drawing power from the darkness to improve your units raw stats, and to keep them alive if they'd die)
  - <Is this enough?>
- You'll only be able to strongly align with one, and weakly align with a second.  You'll need to (mostly) forego the third.
- You'll rebuild the base, grow in power, find new recruits, and learn about the <4?  5?  3?  Whatever> enemy titans.
- You'll send units on many caravan outings.
- You'll discover limited ways of keeping your units if they die
  - Tech (Recover gear on death)
  - Magic (Recover 'magic shard' on death)
  - Darkness (Replace a living person's soul with a deceased person's.  You lose the sacrificed person, but you get the dead person's stats and skills)

- In the late middle
- You'll link back up with the <DEFENDERS_NAME> portal network, and they'll ask you to continue your work
- You'll discover that they've been using the darkness to empower their soldiers and have been using the sacrifice effect to keep the elders alive 
  - Try to frame it as the morally gray side of evil -- they've been using the power to help countless worlds, but also themselves.
- Part of the empowering involves mind wiping people who go through the process
- Players get to choose if they want to side with <DEFENDERS> against the darkness, or if they want to go against both
  - <Is this enough?  Should there be another path?>

- End game involves tracking down the titans and killing them



Note:  If I want to switch this plot line over to that exalted system, it's doable.
The city has been creating its army using the super soldier serum.
    It re-rolls all of your stats (you get to keep the higher of the two rolls for each stat), and also rerolls your backstory.
    The city found a way to force the backstory change to be one that's sympathetic to them
The factions are;
- The police / military (join with the city to defeat its opponents)
   - Trying to crack down on crime locally, and trying to defeat enemies.
   - Sometimes actually the invader, but frequently the defender.
- The priests (Access to some magic, but still mostly aligned with the city.)
   - Trying to track down and contain / destroy magic
   - Trying to keep the status quo as it is
   - Trying to abolish the use of the super soldier serum
- Yourselves (Easy access to money, but you'll kind of be against everyone)
   - ???? What are they trying to do?  By switching sides, they'll piss off everyone.
- Magic users (Also kind of against everyone, but get access to magic)
